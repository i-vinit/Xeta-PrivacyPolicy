## `[1]` What does it store?

 - User IDs for tempmute, report and feedback.

***

 #### 1. Following people can access ALL of the data:
 -  Bot developer(s)

#### 2. Following people can access tempmute:
- Server Moderator(s)

#### 3. Following people can access reports:

***

## `[3]` How can I get rid of the data stored? 

#### 1. To clear your tempmute do one of the following:
- Ask server mod(s) to remove your tempmute.

## Data Removal

### The data removal process goes in two ways

• Discord server data (like custom server settings and temp bans)

• Discord user data (like reminders and pronouns)

Our bot only gathers personally identifiable data through commands run using the bot. This information helps us provide a better user experience for all Xeta's users.

We store this data on MongoDB private cluster and it will be deleted if you are not using our bot for the future.

Note that the data will be reset to the default automatically if the bot is still in your server.

To get user data removed please contact us in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/HVCrytuysw).

All message content will automatically be removed after 2 weeks.

***

## `[4]` Why do we store the data?

#### 1. It stores server IDs for settings and data because:
- Without those most of the bot wouldn't be functional.

#### 2. It stores user IDs for reminders, tempmute, suggestion, report and feedback:
- Bot needs to find the user that has the data stored in the database.

#### 3. It stores server IDs and user IDs for blacklist because:
- We need to prevent people/servers that abuse the bot, break bot rules.

***

## `[5]` What we store for logging?
### While If you are in a server where Champ is setup for logging messages of the discord server then you make sure that your messages which are sent or edited by you are tracked in order to send the message for logging.
### We store your message content and your discord user id because the bot will mention you as the author of the message.

***

## `[6]` What is the usage of Message content?
### Xeta will store some part of your message content in some server where the logging is enabled because the bot will have to log to the server that what message is sent by you which is deleted or edited.
### Xeta will log that message content too which is edited by you that will show the admin what was your actual message in that server.

***

## `[7]` I'm questioning why do you need all this data, and this Privacy Policy doesn't answer my question. What should I do?

#### You can reach us by the following things:
- Join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/HVCrytuysw) on discord
- Contact me on [discord](https://discord.gg/HVCrytuysw)

***
## `[8]` How can we delete our entire data?

### Simply join our support server and ask any of the bot moderator to delete your data. They will delete your entire data without asking any questions.
***

## Please note, that we can change this policy without any warning at any given time.
